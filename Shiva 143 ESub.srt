1
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,880
I'm Shiva!

2
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,640
To have a bright future...

3
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,940
I was paving a path towards it.

4
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:03,880
A relation...

5
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,080
A twist...

6
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,420
Have changed my journey into a love story.

7
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,260
Because of the pain caused in this journey...

8
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,800
I'm before you today.

9
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,320
This Shiva143 is my journey till here.

10
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,780
Hey, Come!
-This place is very nice.

11
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,500
Good Morning sir!

12
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,100
Good Morning Murthy! How's everything going?

13
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:21,960
Actually sir...

14
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,860
Dad, I wanna play.

15
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,780
Okay, go and play!
-Thank you! Bye uncle!

16
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,100
What's the matter Murthy?

17
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,620
Our Kottaguda project is almost getting completed.

18
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,320
I've sent you the documents of Jadcherla plot.

19
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,420
Our office manager is not performing well sir.

20
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,540
If he is not efficient, hire a new one.

21
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,380
Okay sir!

22
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,420
You need not bring these small matters to me.

23
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,860
We have appointed him as manager,
as my son is not in a good condition.

24
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,360
Why is your son in such a condition sir?

25
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,080
Its all my fate Murthy!

26
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,720
One day he is coming down...

27
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,080
Accidentally he fell from stairs and got hit on his head.

28
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,040
That's it! From that he is in this condition.

29
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,540
I've taken him to many hospitals, but no use.

30
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,620
He only go to his friend doctor but no other doctor.

31
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,600
They come every week and give medication.

32
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,060
But still no use.

33
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,600
I earned this for him only.

34
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,140
I wanted to hand over him all these businesses.

35
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,200
But he is in this condition.

36
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,500
Good morning dad!
-Good morning dear!

37
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,480
What's the matter?

38
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,800
This center here is a big success.

39
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,160
Everyone coming here are liking it a lot.

40
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,080
So its going well.

41
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,860
Good! Atleast you are there to take off my burden.

42
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,420
But Murthy, we must be in one sector only.

43
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,160
We should step in multiple sectors at once.

44
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:45,840
Yes sir!

45
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,380
I'm lucky that I have a daughter
to takes good care of the things I tell her.

46
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,800
I forgot to ask dear.

47
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,320
I'm taking care of your marriage arrangements.
But how are the Sangeeth arrangements going?

48
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,340
Ammu already spoke to an event manager about it.

49
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,340
Actually I came here to tell you about that.

50
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,260
You mean that "Ammoru"?

51
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,980
No! Don't call her like that.

52
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,060
She gets angry by that. Just call her Ammu.

53
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,980
Okay! You go and take care of the meeting.

54
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,540
Okay dad, I'll wait there!
-Okay dear! All the best.

55
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,620
Murthy, let's talk our matters now.

56
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,060
They are Bubloo's friends.

57
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,120
They are very good doctors.
These are the one I'm telling you earlier.

58
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,400
Do something and make my son normal.

59
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,660
That's why we are here uncle. Where is he?

60
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,960
He might be some where over there.

61
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,360
Hey leave me. Where are you taking me?

62
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,340
Bubloo, please listen to me.

63
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,640
Its okay, now leave me.

64
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,440
Did you bring it?
-Yeah I did.

65
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,460
Give it to me.

66
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,700
Here it is.

67
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,480
When we say we are treating you, your dad is
thinking that we are giving you medicines.

68
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,720
He doesn't know that you are doing this.

69
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,460
If he comes to know that we gave a fake certificate about your behavior, he'll send us all to prison.

70
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,800
Are you helping me for nothing?

71
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,240
I'll not let that happen. Don't worry I'll take care.

72
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,380
Instead of taking care of your
dad's businesses, why are you doing this?

73
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,000
What do I do? He is asking me to go
to office and work and I don't like that.

74
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,640
He worked hard to earn this
and if I also work hard who'll enjoy all this?

75
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,980
You guys don't speak rules anymore.

76
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,360
If you repeat this, I'll tell my dad
everything and make sure you all go to prison.

77
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,940
No! Please don't do that.

78
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,820
This is friendship. Now take the glasses out.

79
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,800
You said that you'll take care
of my Sangeeth, how's it going?

80
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,200
It seems like this is my marriage, not yours.

81
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,280
I've already spoken to the
event manager he'll meet us here.

82
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,620
We've already finalized some themes.

83
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,060
He'll come and show you once.
-I know you are so sweet.

84
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,820
Though you are in pain because
of the broken engagement...

85
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,560
I gave all these things to you.

86
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,660
Pain? It isn't a love marriage to feel pain.

87
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,460
I just agreed to it, as the family match my status.

88
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,260
Is Ashish calling you?

89
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,800
He is calling. But I'm not answering.

90
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,600
Why do have to bother so much for such small things?

91
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,940
If you are a little patient,
your marriage will also be happening now.

92
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,200
What?

93
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,420
Leave that topic.

94
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,720
By the way, what about our groom's dance?

95
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,200
Our groom?

96
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,900
He is my groom.

97
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,880
Their family hired a choreographer.

98
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,980
So for our performance, we need to hire one.

99
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,900
Whoever the choreographer is...

100
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,820
He'll be dead in my hands.

101
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,060
Hi mam! Good morning.
-Good morning, please sit.

102
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,980
He is our event manager Sanjay!

103
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,040
He is the one who got you the photographer
for your pre-wedding photo shoot.

104
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,080
Oh is it! He did a very good job.

105
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,980
I'm very happy with that photoshoot.
-Thank you so much mam.

106
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,660
We hire only professionals mam.

107
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,280
Client satisfaction of utmost importance for us.

108
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,080
So how are the remaining arrangements going?

109
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,080
Hi sister!
-Hi Bubloo!

110
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,140
Isn't he cured yet?

111
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,500
We took him to many hospitals but no use.

112
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,960
Bubloo you shouldn't do like that. Go away and play.

113
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,640
So, what about the remaining arrangements?

114
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,600
We've mailed all the decors and light theme
samples that you like to our Vizag branch.

115
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,080
So two days before all the arrangements will be done.

116
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,920
Before two days? They were
supposed to be done a week before.

117
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,580
We are paying Lakhs right?

118
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,780
For any Sangeeth, the hall will be
given a day before for the decor.

119
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,120
Hey stop! Don't be rude like that.

120
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,380
You stay out of it. You don't know anything.

121
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,680
I know what to do. We have to dominate.

122
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,840
Whatever it may be. I shouldn't get
any bad remark anywhere.

123
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,760
This is my best friend's Sangeeth.

124
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,760
Don't worry mam!

125
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,860
You know that all the big events
in the city are handled by us.

126
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,700
Yeah I know, that's why I contacted you.

127
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,880
Okay mam, see you.

128
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,000
By the way, who is the choreographer?

129
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,940
Its Shiva! One of the best choreographers.

130
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,360
He'll meet you tomorrow.

131
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,540
Can he deal with rich people like us?

132
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,160
You'll see for yourself.

133
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,240
'Come! Come! Let's dance'

134
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,420
'Come! Come! Lets rock the floor'

135
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,120
'Come! Come! Let's dance'
'Come! Come! Lets rock the floor'

136
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,120
'Never stop in showing your talent'

137
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,300
'Its only one life, so step towards success.'

138
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,300
'Like a untiring flood, create a new history'

139
00:11:52,340 --> 00:12:00,100
'Give your life or take one to win this life'

140
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,900
'If you get a chance, re-write the history'

141
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,980
'No difficulty can stop you'

142
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,280
'Cross the boundaries with your courage'

143
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,240
'Defeat is very common'

144
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,240
'Patience is very important'

145
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,320
'Do not have any excuses'

146
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,200
'Don't worry about what is right and what is not'

147
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:31,960
'Give your life or take one to win this life'

148
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,620
Hey Mandakini, the song has come well.

149
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,120
Pay those dancers and upload
the song in YouTube by evening.

150
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,080
It will get a lot of views.

151
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,380
Good morning Shiva!
-Good morning sir!

152
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,860
I have a small event for you.

153
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,460
Will you do it?
-Sure sir!

154
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,200
Actually client's Sangeeth is in Vizag.

155
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,240
First the practice will be in Hyderabad
and the main event will be in Vizag.

156
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,940
My career started with your events sir.
I'll go where ever you ask me to go.

157
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,860
You'll have a meeting with the client tomorrow.

158
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,600
I'll send you the details and location in Whatsapp.

159
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,620
But be careful Shiva.

160
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,180
Never get angry for anything and...

161
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,260
Don't bring a bad reputation to my company.

162
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,800
Tomorrow evening we have a client meeting.

163
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,900
Get a nice and posh looking sports bike.

164
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,280
You don't worry sir, I'll get you a nice bike.

165
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,700
You stupid! I asked for a sports bike
and you got this brake less scooty?

166
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,500
If I didn't help, you'll curse me and if I did you say this.

167
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,140
It would have been good id you didn't help.

168
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,880
If the client know that we came on a
brake less bike, they'll put breaks to our payment.

169
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,660
Go it? Use your brain sometimes, lets go.

170
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,160
Flip Side?
-It is written correctly.

171
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,480
We came to the correct place.

172
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,500
Let's see if they are inside.

173
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,780
They said they'll be here.

174
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,360
Let's call them.

175
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,140
"Ammoru" it seems.

176
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,500
Hello!
-Hello mam is it Ammoru?

177
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,460
Shut up! This is Ammu not Ammoru. Who are you?

178
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,620
In Truecaller it showed Ammoru mam that's why...

179
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,940
I asked who are you?

180
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,760
I'm choreographer mam and my name is Shiva.

181
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,480
I'm coming from Shreyas media event management.

182
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,200
My manager asked me to meet you at this location.

183
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,000
We are waiting at the location mam.

184
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Can't you wait until I come? Stay there I'm coming.

185
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,620
Why didn't she come yet?

186
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,800
Hello mam! This is Shiva,
celebrity trainer and top event choreographer.

187
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,240
Which celebrities did you train previously?

188
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,580
All that I've trained wanted to become
celebrities mam but they with drew in middle.

189
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,400
That's how perfectly our sir trains.

190
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,460
Do you have any sample videos of your work?

191
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,580
Actually I trained people mostly in other countries mam.

192
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,480
So I don't have client videos with us.

193
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,760
Because at that time the I'm getting
late for the flight so I have to rush back.

194
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,660
We went to a marriage in Vijayawada right?

195
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,600
Then how did you go to
other countries without my knowledge?

196
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,020
Will you shut your mouth for a while please?

197
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,220
Mam basically what kind of style do you prefer?

198
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,900
Like Salsa, Mambo, Jazz, Contemporary or Hip-hop?

199
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,600
Are you done with your over introduction?

200
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,940
Can I speak now?

201
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,040
You come to our place tomorrow
and show us your dance skills.

202
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,820
Choreography should be very nice
or else I'll change the choreographer.

203
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,300
I didn't hire you to do what you say.
I hired you to do what I say.

204
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,940
Understood?

205
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,420
Do you know puppet? You should be like that.

206
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,720
Puppet?

207
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,660
I don't know how we will finish this event with her.

208
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,240
'Money won't come that easy'

209
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,440
Isn't it?

210
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,000
You work for us and still you cheat us?

211
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,660
Did you know the pleasure
it gives when you hit a person?

212
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,420
You can't express it in words.

213
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,260
Oh God! It gives a different high.

214
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,420
Hey!

215
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,300
Why are you beating one of us like that?

216
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,340
Don't you have any common sense?

217
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,880
I'm paying you in every activity I do.

218
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,080
How can you speak to the police against me?

219
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,340
If you do like this, how will I trust you?

220
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,500
Its okay! I forgive you, go.

221
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,340
What? We caught him with great
difficulty and you simply leave him?

222
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,680
Won't you atleast respect our work?

223
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,720
Should I tell you something?

224
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,060
The qualities you have from birth,
will go only with your death.

225
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,900
Did you ever heard this?

226
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,880
No matter what we say, do you really
think these idiots will listen to it and change?

227
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,280
They'll not!

228
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,020
Hello my son!

229
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,420
I love you.

230
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,280
In every house that has talent there
will be a negative character to pull it back.

231
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,620
He is the negative character in our house.

232
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,940
Why do you still smoke and drink? Can't you leave them?

233
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,820
Don't go anywhere, stay home.

234
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,220
We spent a lot for your surgery recently.

235
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,720
You'll never listen to me.

236
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,560
You always keep telling this.

237
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,920
I'm going for bath, if someone comes ask them to sit.

238
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Okay!

239
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,160
Do you know how it will be when Angelina Jolie
lives as a financier in the streets of Hyderabad?

240
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,100
She will be like this.

241
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,740
She is Rubina.

242
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,220
Stop it sister, I beg you.

243
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,040
Is this the way to fight?

244
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,140
If you hit someone, their mind shouldn't work.

245
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
My mind isn't working sister.

246
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,820
Aren't you all ashamed?

247
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,120
Are you all security for me or I'm security for you?

248
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,420
Its total waste to feed and pay you.

249
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,820
You don't talk sister!

250
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,900
You'll talk rules and be strict only with us.

251
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,960
That Shiva is not giving money since two years.

252
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,120
But you still pamper him a lot.

253
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,480
That name gives me...

254
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,180
Vibrations.

255
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,700
Hey Rakul...

256
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,840
I got it sister.

257
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,620
We are doing the same crap since two years.

258
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,700
Come lets get him.

259
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,340
Lets go!

260
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,580
Why are you here?
-Sister asked you to come.

261
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,300
I have an urgent dance class, please leave me.

262
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,760
We don't know all that. Sister asked you so lets go.

263
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,960
No! I won't come.

264
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,020
He won't listen, lets carry him.

265
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,080
Stop it! You saw me yesterday
and still you want to see me today as well.

266
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,360
No matter how many times I see you,
I still feel its like first time.

267
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,720
See Rubina, day by day
your love is becoming a torture for me.

268
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,460
These idiots are not giving me time to change my dress.

269
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,180
Hey don't act smart.

270
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,020
Give him respect. He is my life.

271
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,760
You are killing us sister.

272
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,700
Why don't you give the money back.

273
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,340
If I have money, why would I
come with you daily like this you morons.?

274
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,420
Tell us sister, what's the solution to this?

275
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,120
The only solution to this is him marrying me.

276
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,680
This is better than that.

277
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,760
She loves you that badly,
don't you have any feelings for her?

278
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,320
When you bring me like this, how will I get feelings?

279
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,580
Then what should I do?

280
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,800
Shall I give an idea?

281
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:43,900
All of you look up.

282
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,680
I know that you'll go, that's why I kept him there.

283
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,260
Get him inside. I'll feed him with biryani.

284
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,900
The reason for them to take me is...

285
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,800
Why did you come here?

286
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,860
I'm missing you and so I'm here.

287
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,600
I was about to come to you.

288
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,380
You miss me too?

289
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,360
That's why I came.

290
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,980
This is love.

291
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,160
Do you accept my love?

292
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,160
I want to discuss a serious matter with you Rubina.

293
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,340
My father is sick.

294
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,520
I should pay Four Lakhs for the surgery.

295
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,660
Please help me.

296
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,240
Since childhood, I kept on coming after you.

297
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,840
But you never cared me.

298
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,980
Now you came to me as you want money.

299
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,960
But still I'll lend you loan, on one condition.

300
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,900
You should come and meet me whenever I miss you.

301
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,300
If you didn't come on your own, my men will bring you.

302
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,460
Okay?

303
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,320
I have no other option than agreeing to this.

304
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,540
You idiots!

305
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,820
Do you know martial arts or what, jumping like that?

306
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,460
If I learnt it completely, I would have hit you here itself.

307
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,440
Don't you have any shame to bring me like this?

308
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,920
We are doing this as our sister asked us to do,
but not because we love you.

309
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,380
Mr. Rubina!

310
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,040
Tell me how far its fair to bring a
person like this without his consent?

311
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,280
Hey send him inside.

312
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,620
Why are you laughing?

313
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,680
I recalled something from our childhood,
do you want me to tell you my dear?

314
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,180
You'll anyways tell me.

315
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,160
When you are being mischievous in school,
teacher punished you by making you stand on bench.

316
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,020
So?

317
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,440
Then...

318
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:48,940
Wait!

319
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,620
Why you guys are laughing?

320
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,580
Our sister is laughing so we are also laughing.

321
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,780
Then Shiva, while standing on the bench...

322
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,460
Hey all lets laugh now.

323
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,700
When did you guys bring me here.

324
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,320
Will you eat sweet dear?
-No!

325
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,960
What about Biryani?
-No I won't!

326
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,540
Atleast eat Upma.
-I won't eat anything.

327
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,560
You bought me while I was in sleep
and asking about food, let me go.

328
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,500
Sit!

329
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Hey you, come here.

330
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,500
How did I controlled him sister?

331
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,360
With respect.

332
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,020
I remembered another thing from childhood, shall I tell?

333
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,200
You go ahead sister!

334
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,440
Hey wait a minute. You guys get out.

335
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,380
Do you remember once teacher appreciated you?

336
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,420
Hey you all come here. Now tell me.

337
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,840
You failed in Hindi exam right?

338
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,400
Not about the exam, tell me the one about appreciation.

339
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,360
It is that, you always fail in Hindi exam.

340
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,680
Stop it!

341
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,900
Not this one, the appreciation one.

342
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,820
Its the same, you failed in the exam,
teacher pulled your pants and...

343
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,160
Because of the money I took, I got stuck up with her.

344
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,020
Why is he calling me now?

345
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,900
Hey dude!
-Why don't you answer my call?

346
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,480
My financial position is not so
good now so I didn't answer your call.

347
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,700
She is always taking me like a child whenever she want.

348
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,080
I don't know what you'll do,
I want back the money I gave you.

349
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,280
Then let's do one thing.

350
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,880
Someone from Vizag wants to buy my car.

351
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,400
If we deliver the car to the, we'll get some money.

352
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,820
From that I'll give your one Lakh.

353
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,320
I lend you money and you tell me the way to get it?

354
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,260
Understand me dude!
-Its okay! Bye.

355
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,240
Hey who are you?
-We are from Shreyas media sir.

356
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,300
Oh! Are you the food suppliers?

357
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,520
No sir!

358
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,600
Then light suppliers?
-No sir!

359
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,820
Then flower decorators?
-We are choreographers sir.

360
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,380
Oh you are those choreographers?

361
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,240
I can hire Prabhudeva but you know why did I hired you?

362
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,600
We have to encourage the youth.
-Oh! Thank you sir.

363
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,300
So you should perform really well.

364
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,620
The dance should be extraordinary.
-You'll see for yourself sir.

365
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,580
By the way, I forgot to tell you something.

366
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,480
This entire building is mine.

367
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,980
But I didn't ask about that sir.

368
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,100
You need not ask, its my duty to tell you.

369
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,640
Can we do our work now?
-Yeah! Go quick.

370
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,820
Thank you sir. Hey let's go.

371
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,080
Son?
-Yes dad!

372
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,180
While they dance, we should also
learn them and rock the dance floor.

373
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,860
So they'll take care of the decor.

374
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,300
Today is recording session, do you know that?

375
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,500
Yes mam! You'll record while we dance
and forward it to Megha mam's friends.

376
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,580
You trained them well.
-Its nothing, now watch.

377
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,520
Did you prepare well for a nice song?

378
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,080
Yes mam, I prepared well for a very nice song.

379
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,240
Hey Mandakini, play the music.

380
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:59,940
(Song from Telugu movie "Gang Leader")

381
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,760
What non-sense is this?

382
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,700
Its a Sangeeth in a star hotel,
not some function in a street.

383
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,040
Let it be dear. Audience like mass songs.

384
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,860
This is not a movie to have a
mass number for the audience.

385
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,680
This is marriage event right?

386
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,360
You don't know anything about this, so please be quite.

387
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,280
We don't know it seems, let's go.

388
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,080
Oh god! Its nice song, let it be.

389
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,040
Megha you don't know anything, don't argue.

390
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,860
You'll look very cheap in front of the groom's family.

391
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,200
I want to present you in a high level,
but you want to be this?

392
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,860
This is all because of you.

393
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,960
Wait, I'll call the event manager.

394
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,620
I've seen a lot of these.

395
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,180
Mr. Srinivas!

396
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,920
This guy, your choreographer...

397
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,420
Please mam! We'll do the way you like.

398
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,520
Srinivas, I'll call you later.

399
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,620
Tomorrow, I'll come up with a better song mam.

400
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,100
That's okay Shiva.

401
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,060
Tomorrow we'll practice for the remaining songs.

402
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,960
There is no practice tomorrow. I have a short film shoot.

403
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,020
Which short film?

404
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,480
The one I told you a few days back.
-Oh that! Okay.

405
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,040
Lets do how much we can here.
For the remaining we'll hire a choreographer in Vizag.

406
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,960
After three days we are going
to Vizag in the morning flight.

407
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,560
So if you come to the airport
at the exact time, we'll all go together.

408
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,020
By the way Shiva, how are you coming?

409
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,120
I have some important work in Vizag.

410
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,440
So, I'm going in my friend's car. After that I'll join you.

411
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,860
Okay see you there.
-Sure mam!

412
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,940
Mam you said that you'll give the advance cheque.

413
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,400
You did nothing and you want cheque?

414
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,980
I gave it to your manager, go and collect it.

415
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,620
Hey wait a minute! Put me down.

416
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,940
You'll always have something coming up.

417
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,220
Just a minute.

418
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,500
Who is this?

419
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,320
Hey Shiva! I'm your dad's friend.

420
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,380
Its been two months since your dad
took money from me still he didn't pay me back.

421
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,740
He is not even answering my calls.
Does he have the intention of giving it back?

422
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,720
I'll talk to my dad.

423
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,580
As his son, you are responsible for his debts.

424
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,120
I want the money immediately.

425
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,740
I'm not responsible for that, you deal it with him.

426
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,820
How can you say that? As his son you should pay me.

427
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,000
Did you ask me while giving him money you idiot.

428
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,020
Hey give respect.

429
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,900
I'm not in a good mood today. Tell her that I'll not come.

430
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,320
Hell with your mood. Our sister want to see you, come.

431
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,360
You and your sister will always want to see me.

432
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,120
Don't you understand?

433
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,980
He'll not listen like this. I'll tie him.

434
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,500
Wait! Wait!

435
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,560
Look for him all around.

436
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,480
Where did he disappear all of a sudden?

437
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,180
There he is. Hey stop!

438
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,140
You guys go that way. You go this way.

439
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,620
I got him!

440
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,720
Huh! You got me?
-Yeah, I did.

441
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,920
Hey! Sister asked us to not hit him.

442
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,160
You are following the rules well.

443
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,520
Come lets go!

444
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,300
What's the time?

445
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,900
Time? I don't have watch.

446
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,140
Oh! Ask them.
-I'll ask and come.

447
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,840
Hey you come, come.

448
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,980
Hey! Stop, stop.

449
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,280
What happened?

450
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,580
Stop it you morons. She asks you to
bring me and you guys come after me.

451
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,180
Neither you have brains nor she.

452
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,120
Why should we run like this.
Wait for five minutes, we'll dance.

453
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,460
What do you say?

454
00:35:17,540 --> 00:36:00,120
(Song from old movie "Gentleman")

455
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,680
Hello Megha!
-Yeah tell me.

456
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,600
Gym trainer is here. We are waiting for you.

457
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,540
I can't come today.

458
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,260
Oh! Okay, bye!

459
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,780
Mam if you don't mind can I give you a suggestion?

460
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,280
Tell me.

461
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,460
If we do workouts in the morning,
we'll have more health benefits mam.

462
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,720
I'll get other instructor for the morning,
you stop coming in the evening.

463
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,100
No need mam. Evening is really good.

464
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,620
What are we doing today?

465
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,440
Yesterday we did upper body, today we'll do lower body.

466
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,580
We'll do workouts for legs.

467
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,260
No!

468
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,340
Today I'm having full body pains.

469
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,400
Only my hands are fine. So we'll do hands.

470
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,080
It will be good if we follow a systematic order mam.

471
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,640
This is my order.

472
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:50,840
Okay mam!

473
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,840
Here is the dumbbell.

474
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,680
20 reps per set.

475
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,840
Do you have any problem if I do 10?

476
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,460
No mam! As your wish.

477
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,000
I forgot. There is dance class today?

478
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,200
Yeah mam!

479
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,660
Okay then, you can go.

480
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,680
We'll practice on the track I've sent you.

481
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,700
Okay. We'll do that.

482
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,100
Its not like that mam.

483
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,160
You have to do it like this.
-I know, but its good like this.

484
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,780
Its good like that, but...

485
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,420
Then we'll do it like this.

486
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,460
Okay. We'll move on to next one.

487
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,920
Its not like that. Its like this.

488
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,180
But still this is good.

489
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,080
It feels really painful mam.
-For what?

490
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,600
I'm telling you its really painful.
-Okay, but for what?

491
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,640
If someone else ruins our work, its really painful.

492
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:37,500
Why do you have to feel sad? Are you doing it for free?

493
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,440
Just a sec, I'll call your manager.

494
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,120
As if you are doing it for free. I'll teach you a lesson.

495
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,040
What? What's your domination?

496
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,260
Pain? My foot!

497
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,080
As a choreographer I said that mam, nothing else.

498
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,500
Even though you are the choreographer,
it should happen the way I say.

499
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,740
Then you'll be the choreographer mam, not me.

500
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,460
So what do you say now?

501
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,620
Everything will happen the way you want from now.

502
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,680
Okay mam?

503
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,880
Then why do I need you, I can do it myself.

504
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,200
How is our songs choreography going?

505
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:21,400
Not good. Half of the time is
wasted in showing his creativity.

506
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,920
With great difficulty, only four songs were completed.

507
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,320
That's it? Then when will we practice?

508
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,060
After few days we'll go to Vizag.

509
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,060
I'll pay him only if he comes there
and complete the remaining songs.

510
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,160
He's a good dancer, I know that.

511
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,700
You might have caused him
trouble by interfering in his work.

512
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,180
I want camera.
-What for?

513
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,320
I'm producing a short film.

514
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,620
I need to get its making.

515
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,280
Your acting like a producer now!

516
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,780
Okay! There are my pre-wedding shoot photos in it.

517
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,240
So please don't format that memory card.

518
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,100
Don't worry. I'll keep it safe.

519
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,320
You go now, I'll call you after my work.

520
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,480
Bubloo you play here. I'll come in a bit.

521
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,360
Okay sister!

522
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,700
How's the shoot going?

523
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,940
Its almost climax mam.
Now the suicide scene is in progress.

524
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,520
Location is on third floor mam.

525
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,940
Then what are you waiting for?

526
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,540
We are waiting for the cameraman mam.

527
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,160
Okay then, I'll go to third floor then.

528
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,860
Manager gave me the cheque mam.
I need your sign on it.

529
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,400
Oh! I'm sorry Shiva.

530
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,800
Actually Ammu is handling
all the transactions, go and meet her.

531
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,780
Mam if you don't mind, can I ask you something?

532
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,960
Tell me Shiva.

533
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,900
It will be nice if you involve for your marriage.

534
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,280
She is torturing me for everything.

535
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,640
You speak to her once about his mam, please.

536
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:21,900
Okay I'll talk to her.

537
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,740
Mam I got the second installment cheque.

538
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,600
Client signature is needed at the back of the form.

539
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,400
If you tell me where you are,
I'll come and get your signature.

540
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,920
Meet me tomorrow, I'll sign it.

541
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,440
Tomorrow is bank holiday mam.

542
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,440
If you can sign it today,
the transaction will be processed.

543
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,240
Please help me today mam.

544
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,960
I'll share you the location in Whatsapp.

545
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:51,920
Come!

546
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,660
What a woman!

547
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,160
She is paying me just 20K but
her attitude is like as if she is paying me a million.

548
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,220
Did I hit him good?

549
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,120
Thank god!

550
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,640
Now our sir will speak. Sir carry on.

551
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,080
Basically Murthy...

552
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,260
All the humans are living like sheep.

553
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,780
Do you know how?

554
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,780
I'll tell you three points, listen.

555
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,440
Point one.

556
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,940
Parents work really hard and buy a house.

557
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,680
As it will be handy always.

558
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,440
But actually he'll not enjoy it,
neither will let his children enjoy.

559
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,120
And finally he'll die.

560
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,800
Point Two.

561
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,320
Will the children enjoy it after growing up?

562
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,800
They keep thinking that the property
cost will increase as time progresses.

563
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,500
Point Three!

564
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,880
The children of these type of parents are intelligent.

565
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,740
He isn't a fool not to enjoy the property.

566
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,480
He is enjoying the two generation's properties.

567
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,560
No matter how much you hit or scare me,
I'll not sell you the land.

568
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,540
I know you'll say this, that's why I have fourth point.

569
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,640
She should be here.

570
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,580
Where is she!

571
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,040
Where is she?

572
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,760
Here you are mam!

573
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,100
What happened mam? Why are they after you?

574
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,700
I came here to record the making of a short film.

575
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,360
Unexpectedly I've recorded a murder scene.

576
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,060
Understood!

577
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,500
Instead of taking this making,
you took that murder making.

578
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,260
Why do you interfere in everything?

579
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,020
I didn't do it intentionally.
-Okay, stop!

580
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,180
We should get out of here immediately.

581
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,480
I don't know how to jump.
-Its okay, jump!

582
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,020
Mam listen to me. If we give them
the camera, they'll not come after us.

583
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,040
Its Megha's camera.

584
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,040
We can buy a lot later. Listen to me,
lets atleast give them the memory card.

585
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,320
Megha's photos are in it.

586
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,680
Oh god! Girls and their madness for photos, huh!

587
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,660
Lets do one thing.

588
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,980
Please listen to me this time and hold this.

589
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,700
Hello! What do you mean?

590
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,800
I'm very scared.

591
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,620
Me too! You be quite for a while.

592
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,120
Turn around!

593
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,160
Be like that.

594
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,480
Is it empty?

595
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:09,480
Empty?

596
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:12,980
Now its empty.

597
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,400
Mam recorded it unexpectedly sir.

598
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,920
We live a very normal life sir.
We don't want these things.

599
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,800
What normal life? I have my own status, okay?

600
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,480
Keep your status aside for a while.

601
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,540
Hey! Give me that camera.

602
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,820
Give them the camera.

603
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,420
Here is the camera sir.

604
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,020
We are done here sir.

605
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,380
Sorry sir! We'll leave.

606
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,900
My camera!
-You please be silent!

607
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,140
There is no memory card in it.

608
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:12,520
Stop them!

609
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,320
Kill him!

610
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,160
Let's go in this car.

611
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:43,760
They are shooting Bubloo. Stop the car once.

612
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,380
If we stop now, they'll kill us.

613
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,420
I told you to give them the card, see now.

614
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,260
You asked me to come to your home, I'm right outside.

615
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,160
Come inside. I'm in my room upstairs.

616
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,380
Okay, coming.

617
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,240
Don't know why did she called me.

618
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,240
Hello mam!

619
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,200
Hello! Sit down.

620
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,560
What's the matter mam?

621
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,360
Its about the song selection.

622
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,980
Give me some latest songs.

623
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,400
Every song seems to be regular and routine.

624
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:42,980
You suggest me something.

625
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,420
You might be the choreographer,
but everything should happen as I say.

626
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,080
You should be like a puppet.

627
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,100
No problem mam. You tell us and we'll follow.

628
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,300
You'll be having some knowledge on it , right?

629
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,800
We may go accordingly.

630
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,040
Suggest me some very good songs.

631
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,800
Actually mam. We have a very less hit movies.

632
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,040
So, in every function they are playing the same songs.

633
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,760
My suggestion is that we'll go for retro.

634
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,360
If we have Chiranjeevi sir's and
Nagarjuna sir's old songs...

635
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,800
I think it will be very interesting.

636
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:15,900
What do you say?

637
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,780
Not a very good idea.

638
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,880
I thought you'll suggest me some nice ones,
but why are you suggesting me old ones?

639
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,800
Your opinion is useless.

640
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,300
It doesn't work.

641
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,620
I'll only think of something.

642
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:32,980
Then why do you have to ask me?

643
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,400
What?

644
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,000
If you have your opinion, why do you have to ask me?

645
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,600
I just asked, what's wrong in that?

646
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,380
That's what I'm saying.

647
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,440
If you have your opinion, why do you have to ask me?

648
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:51,020
You always complain about something or the other.

649
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,520
I know that whatever you say is for my good.

650
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,200
Tell me mam, what shall we do?

651
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,340
You are getting angry, right?

652
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,260
No mam!

653
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,040
You are getting angry, right?
-No mam. I'm perfect.

654
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,040
No! you are getting angry.

655
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,300
No mam! Why would I get angry?

656
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,360
I'm fed up with this fellow. I want to change this guy.

657
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,920
I'm calling your manager right now.

658
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,980
You are showing me a lot of attitude.

659
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,000
Me?
-If not me?

660
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,080
Why are you looking like that?

661
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,120
When I said that I don't know
how to jump the wall you made fun of me.

662
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,940
Do you think you fought like "Jackie Chan"

663
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,060
And you spoke something about me with Megha.

664
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,040
Am I torturing you?

665
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,780
Who me?
-What "Who me"?

666
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,760
You are not so innocent, okay?

667
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:00,720
Stop acting.

668
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,420
Mam actually what happened is...
-Shut up!

669
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:05,420
I've already wrote some songs, just see.

670
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,640
Here are the fake documents for the land you've asked.

671
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,200
In my service, this is the 48th land that you've captured.

672
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,020
If you occupy two more, it will half century.

673
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,420
Did you get them?

674
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,020
No we didn't.

675
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,480
I'll get their details.

676
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:14,980
That girl recorded the whole murder.

677
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,880
I want the recorded memory card along with the girl.

678
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,000
What! Someone recorded your illegal deeds?

679
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,100
Do you how risky if that goes out?

680
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,880
You, me and everyone here will go to prison.

681
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,860
I'm already tensed. Don't make me more tensed, got it?

682
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,920
48 missed calls!

683
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:20,960
Sorry Megha!

684
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,060
Driver isn't available, so I'm coming in a cab.

685
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,740
Coming, I'm on the way.

686
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,040
On your way to where? You've already missed the flight.

687
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,480
We are in Vizag already. Do you know that?

688
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,820
Why are you not answering my calls?

689
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,500
Why did I get the flight tickets four days in advance?

690
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,440
To do our shopping, right?

691
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,960
Now thanks to you everything is ruined.

692
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,800
Really sorry Megha!

693
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,000
I don't know what you'll do, you must be here soon.

694
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,500
Why are you tensed dear?

695
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,900
Ammu missed her flight dad.

696
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,760
Let me talk to her.

697
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,980
Hello!
-Yeah uncle.

698
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,580
Did you miss your flight dear?
-Yes uncle!

699
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,760
I will send you a good driver, come with him.

700
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,280
Who is that driver?

701
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,640
Its our choreographer.

702
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:10,740
He is coming to Vizag on some work, come in his car.

703
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:15,200
Journey with him?

704
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:16,940
No way!

705
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,920
No other option dear. We shouldn't care
about prestige in these circumstances.

706
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,220
We should get down a little when necessary.

707
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,780
I asked you to give my money
back and you gave me some work.

708
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,160
You are very intelligent.

709
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,780
One shot you'll clear my debt and sell your car.

710
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:34,600
Keys?

711
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:40,180
Atleast I can show off with the car in Vizag.

712
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,180
Why is he calling me now!

713
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,600
Tell me sir.
-Where are you?

714
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,900
I'm getting started to Vizag sir.

715
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:52,120
Ammu missed her flight in the morning.

716
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:55,300
Can you bring her here along with you?

717
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,280
Sorry sir, that is not part of my job.

718
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,640
I'm just a choreographer.

719
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,480
I know that you'll say this.

720
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,080
That's why I've already
talked to your Manager about this.

721
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,360
Talk all this with him.

722
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,060
Why do he have to do this?

723
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,300
See matter is closed.

724
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,780
Good morning sir, tell me.

725
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,460
Our client Ammu mam missed her flight.

726
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:30,020
Actually I'm going on my personal work sir.
I'll join them after it is completed.

727
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,960
Shiva stop talking rules now.

728
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,700
If its not okay for you, this will be our last event.

729
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,320
But that is not part of my job sir.

730
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,380
Okay fine! This will be our last event.

731
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:44,320
Its okay sir no problem.
Its just pick and drop right sir? I will take care.

732
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,000
I'm dead!

733
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,200
Hello mam, get in.

734
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,180
Keep my luggage in the trunk.

735
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,440
I'm a choreographer, not driver.

736
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:20,720
You keep it in.

737
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,480
Is it so!

738
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,260
One minute.

739
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:26,600
Got it.

740
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,160
I'll keep the luggage inside.

741
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,580
Get a water bottle on the way.

742
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,520
Mam shall we go?
-Yeah! Lets go.

743
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,000
I want water bottle.

744
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,500
I know mam. That's why I stopped the vehicle.

745
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,480
Wait for a while, I'll bring it.

746
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,580
Hello dear Good morning!
-Good morning dad!

747
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:21,300
You should be going to Vizag, did you reach the airport?

748
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:24,720
No dad! I missed the flight, so going by road.

749
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,960
I called you regarding that marriage proposal.

750
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,240
Daddy, I already told you.

751
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,900
You are important to me.

752
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,240
Do it the way you like.

753
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:35,720
But... You should be okay with it too.

754
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,580
Dad! I am okay with anything you like.

755
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:39,740
Give me a water bottle.

756
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:46,240
Boss, we have information that they are going Vizag.

757
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,440
We are waiting for them on the way.

758
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,960
As soon as we find them,
we will get the card and bring it to you.

759
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:00,920
How did you reach before I do?

760
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:06,460
Well... She said she was thirsty...

761
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,060
Catch him!

762
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:28,160
Hey, stop there!

763
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,900
What happened? How are they?

764
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,160
Who else? Your fans.

765
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:35,860
So much for recording and hiding it.

766
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,120
They now know we are going to Vizag.

767
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,040
If we get caught, we are dead.

768
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,720
I told you give them the card, but you didn't listen to me.

769
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,220
I told you there are Megha's photos in that card.

770
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,420
Oh please! You'd always say something.

771
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,340
I am hungry.

772
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,200
I said I am hungry. Why did you bring me here?

773
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,900
There are no star hotels anywhere near here.

774
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,200
Where is the waiter?

775
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,300
Shiva! They are watching us.

776
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,760
I suspect something.

777
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,200
It might be them.

778
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,000
No doubt, it is them.

779
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,360
Why are you coming after me instead of her?

780
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,060
I don't want her. We need you.

781
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:06,800
Let's go.

782
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,980
She is the one who recorded,
why are you taking me?

783
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:16,500
Hey, Rakul?

784
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,840
How did you find out?
-Why wouldn't I?

785
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,720
Who else will come 100 K.M.s for me? Useless idiots!

786
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,480
You'll kill me or what?

787
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,780
She asks us to bring you with out hitting.

788
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:30,220
But you keep on escaping from us.

789
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:34,400
Lets do one thing, lets eat mutton biryani and go.

790
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,620
She knows what to do, lets go.

791
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:05,860
Who are they?

792
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,320
I have an one sided love story.

793
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:09,160
Do you love someone?

794
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,060
No! I was being loved.

795
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,180
Great! There are people who love you.

796
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:15,860
Who is she?

797
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,280
Sweet heart!

798
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,720
I'm here!

799
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:30,960
When did you get in?

800
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:36,280
While you were escaping
from them like a little Krishna...

801
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,920
Then I got in the back seat silently.

802
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,460
I'm going on an important event, please leave me.

803
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,600
I'll be back in three days.

804
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,700
Oh no! I should spend three days without seeing you?

805
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:48,380
I can't!

806
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,620
That too with a girl.

807
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:52,880
God!

808
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,780
Can you come and sit in the back seat?

809
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:58,840
No! I'm comfortable here.

810
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:06,740
Now tell me!

811
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,140
This journey will be very beautiful, isn't it sweet heart?

812
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,260
My fate sucks!

813
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:10,480
Who is she?

814
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,580
She's Ammu mam, my client.

815
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:14,520
Client?

816
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,100
Yes client!

817
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,500
She's learning dance from me.

818
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:22,060
I asked you many times to teach me, but you didn't.

819
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,020
You are dancing with my life, why do I teach you again?

820
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:26,080
Eat!

821
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,820
You look very cute when you are angry.

822
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:36,640
Bill please!

823
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,380
Why did you stop here?

824
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,000
We ate just now so I'm feeling drowsy.

825
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,420
If I drive like this, we'll definitely have an accident.

826
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:08,060
If you drive non-stop, we'll reach Vizag by morning.

827
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,880
I'm not a bus driver to drive non-stop.

828
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,540
Don't torture me mam, let me sleep.

829
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,660
You sleep. I'll keep on looking at you the whole night.

830
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:51,460
Where is Ammu?

831
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,420
No matter how much you look for her you'll not find her.

832
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,100
Because she is with me.

833
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,740
You are in deep sleep last night.

834
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,080
So I didn't disturb you.

835
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,420
She knows where the card is, so we got her.

836
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,100
Now she says that she doesn't where the card is.

837
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:23,400
If you have any info, please tell you.

838
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:25,680
Don't do anything to her.

839
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,580
The card is with me.

840
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,200
I'll send you the location in Whatsapp.

841
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,680
Give me the card and take her.

842
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,320
Even I don't have the card.

843
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,300
But I should rescue her somehow.

844
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:45,780
Where is she?

845
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,180
Some goons kidnapped her.

846
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:50,180
We should save her.

847
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,700
Why should you rescue her?

848
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:54,400
She is my client and I'm going to
do choreography for their event only.

849
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,800
How will the event happen without her?

850
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,220
I don't think so.

851
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,540
I feel that you are showing more interest in her.

852
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:02,560
Interest? My foot!

853
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,440
I'm just being responsible for my client.

854
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,160
Is it?

855
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,280
She is beautiful than me, so...

856
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:10,800
You might be showing interest in her.

857
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,860
What? She is beautiful than you?

858
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,660
Tell me, Is she beautiful than you?

859
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,140
Tell me heartfully, is she really beautiful than you?

860
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,160
Just tell me frankly.

861
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,880
Does anyone in the world can
speak Telugu so cute like you?

862
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,040
Ofcourse, you are right.

863
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,320
Is this what you understand all these days?

864
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:32,140
Lets go sweet heart.

865
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,900
She'll not get convinced if I didn't say all this.

866
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:01,600
This is the location.

867
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:03,520
They might be here.

868
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:15,580
They are very dangerous. We should be very careful.

869
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:17,400
They don't know about me.

870
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:18,660
That's what I'm afraid of.

871
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:20,320
Lets go.

872
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,480
What's the time bro?
-I don't have a watch.

873
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:49,380
I know.

874
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,260
Ganesh bro!

875
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,240
We kidnapped the girl and kept her with us.

876
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,580
You don't worry at all.

877
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,260
Give me the phone once. I'll speak.

878
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,160
With great difficulty we got her boss.

879
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:17,080
What's the difficulty in getting a sleeping girl you idiot.

880
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,880
Somehow or the other, get the card from her.

881
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:23,520
After that kill the girl.

882
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,780
Understood?
-You don't worry boss.

883
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:30,760
We have Rajahmundry's Sayed bhai with us.

884
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,400
No one can take her from us.

885
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,460
Either kill her or get the card.

886
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:37,960
If not I'll kill you.

887
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,400
I'll not give you that chance.

888
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,920
I've already sent him the location.

889
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,700
He is coming here with the card.

890
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,420
I'll not leave him this time.

891
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:49,500
Okay!

892
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:57,240
I won't get angry usually.

893
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:58,960
Where is the card?

894
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,960
That card is not with us right now.

895
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,520
Again same dialogue.

896
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:18,300
Hey looks like he is here, go get him.

897
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:32,020
Lets do one thing, you go that way and I'll go this.

898
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,760
If you find her, get her to the car.

899
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:34,880
I'll not get her.

900
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:37,600
Please understand me, its her event.

901
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,400
Who are you?

902
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,260
Got it!

903
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:03,920
You are his girl.

904
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:22,560
Where is she bro?

905
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:29,400
You hit me for asking a question?

906
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,060
I can't fight these many.

907
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,160
Who are you?

908
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,460
Hey do you who am I? I'm Rajahmundry's don.

909
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,000
What took you so long Shiva? Get me out of here.

910
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,880
You stay here. Let's go.

911
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,720
Come, untie me.

912
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,320
You are commanding here as well.

913
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:07,800
Hey find them.
-Okay bro!

914
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:11,060
Lets go.

915
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,060
Will you leave me and go sweet heart?

916
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:20,240
Oh god! She is killing me.

917
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:53,380
Shiva you should hit the one
with big mustache really hard.

918
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,520
He is very arrogant you know.

919
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,060
He kept on asking me about the card, senseless fellow.

920
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,280
Hello mam, why do have to say that?

921
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:03,960
Give me the card and I'll go.

922
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:08,600
Why don't you listen to me?
Why do you keep on asking me about it?

923
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:34,740
Don't worry about the card bro. I'll tell you where it is.

924
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,180
Who are you and why are you always interfering?

925
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,400
How dare you hit my sweet heart?

926
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,200
They are fools Rubina, they won't listen to you.

927
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,940
Leave them, we'll go.

928
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:55,520
No, I'll not leave him.

929
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,780
She won't listen, let's go.

930
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,200
Hey she is still there.

931
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,160
They will be in danger because of her, get in.

932
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,900
Dude its me Shiva.
-Tell me.

933
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,960
I'm coming to Vizag with a girl.

934
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,700
We have a problem with some people.

935
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:21,760
They are chasing us.
-Chase?

936
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:24,860
Are you in love or what?

937
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,300
Its nothing like love.

938
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:31,780
If we have any problem,
can we stay at your house for the night?

939
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:36,440
No problem. I have a pent house,
you can stay in it as long as you want.

940
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,100
Hello sir!
-Hey Mandakini!

941
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,220
Megha mam and family are in the Vizag farm house.

942
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,120
You get that address and go there, okay?

943
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,700
Okay sir, when will you come?
-I'm in some problem.

944
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,580
I'll be late.

945
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:07,300
No problem sir I'll take care.
What about the remaining songs?

946
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,960
I'll do the remaining songs
choreography once I come there.

947
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,840
One more thing...

948
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:15,560
Mandakini can you hear me?

949
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:20,740
Speak!

950
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,160
Can you here me?

951
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:35,600
He is saying something.

952
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:13,300
What are you doing here?
Why don't you tell me before you go?

953
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,320
I don't have to tell you.

954
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:20,740
You should tell me.

955
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:24,300
My dying every second
fearing what might happen to you.

956
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,560
They took you only a while ago.

957
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:28,080
What if they come again?

958
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,800
I'm saving you and you are very mean to me.

959
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,740
My work is just choreography.
Why should I care about all these?

960
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,080
Taking you to Vizag and saving
you is such a waste of time.

961
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:41,660
Who asked you to save me?

962
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:47,820
I'll kill you if you saying anything rude like this.

963
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:52,960
Your right.

964
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:54,760
Why should I save you?

965
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:57,120
I don't care about you anymore.

966
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,380
Good bye!

967
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:36,820
How are you?
-I'm fine!

968
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,840
All okay?
-Everything is fine.

969
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,940
We'll leave 5.30 in the morning.

970
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,980
No problem, you can leave when ever you want.

971
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:47,700
Show her the room, she'll freshen up.

972
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,160
Here take the bag.

973
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:05,620
I'll kill you if you again speak rude.

974
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,860
Taking you to Vizag and saving
you is such a waste of time.

975
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:14,620
I don't care about you anymore, good bye.

976
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:24,160
'How did the god made you so beautiful'

977
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:25,900
Why is she crying?

978
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:38,680
What happened? Why are you crying?

979
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:42,760
How can you speak like that with a girl?

980
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:45,100
You can't talk to me like that, okay?

981
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:47,520
You should respect me.

982
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:50,300
Even my dad haven't spoke to me like that.

983
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,660
Yeah! That's why...

984
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:53,160
You are like this.

985
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:57,360
If your father spoke with you
the way I did long back you'll not be like this.

986
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,000
Respect? my foot.

987
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:02,080
But still you should respect me, right?

988
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:06,520
What do you mean by respect?

989
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,300
Come on tell me.

990
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,960
Respect is respect.

991
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,640
It should have some definition right?

992
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:21,020
Who will give you respect in your house?

993
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:24,320
My driver.
-And?

994
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,700
Our maid.
-And?

995
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:29,580
My dad's employees.

996
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,900
They all respect you because they work for you.

997
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:33,780
That means...

998
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,120
They respect you only because you pay them.

999
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,380
Otherwise who will respect you?

1000
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:42,900
Not only them...

1001
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:45,980
90% in the world will respect others
only because of their necessities.

1002
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:47,880
Not because they really mean it.

1003
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:51,120
I'll tell you a secret.

1004
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,260
Come here.

1005
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,980
I started liking you very much.

1006
01:23:59,160 --> 01:23:59,780
Not only that.

1007
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,300
You looked very beautiful to me.

1008
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,360
But no smart person will love you.

1009
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:05,920
Do you know why?

1010
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,000
Where are my eyes?

1011
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:10,400
Isn't it?

1012
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,340
Do you know where your eyes are?

1013
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:15,440
They are on your head.

1014
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:17,800
Didn't get it?

1015
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,980
Due to the wealth, beauty and
arrogance your eyes are on your head.

1016
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:22,780
That's why you are don't treat anyone nicely.

1017
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:25,540
Once keep your eyes in their place and look.

1018
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:27,880
The whole world will look beautiful.

1019
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,180
Saying all this all my high is gone.

1020
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,200
This is enough for today, sleep.

1021
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:18,080
Its 4.30 AM!

1022
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,700
Go get ready, we'll leave.

1023
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,220
I need to talk to you.

1024
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:29,720
Tell me.

1025
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:33,180
Like you said...

1026
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:36,400
Saving me is not your responsibility.

1027
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,300
But still you are doing a lot for me.

1028
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,660
Without noticing that, I've troubled youso much.

1029
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:53,420
Not the sorry, but the last words saying trouble are...

1030
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,140
That gave me the real high.

1031
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,660
I bless you to stay happy and
understand me like this always.

1032
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:05,880
Stop it!

1033
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:45,360
'My feet started running to get to you'

1034
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:51,140
'I have started writing letters on your heart from today'

1035
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:56,200
'Time which used to travel fast has slowed down now'

1036
01:27:56,540 --> 01:28:01,860
'This journey with you, has now become thrilling'

1037
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:07,020
'I have a lot of words in heart but they aren't coming out'

1038
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:12,700
'Shall I tell you in a word that you are mine'

1039
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:18,020
'Listen to me my dear, I love you heartfully'

1040
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:23,540
'Whatever may happen, I'll live with the love on you'

1041
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:28,780
'Listen to me my dear, I love you heartfully'

1042
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:34,580
'Whatever may happen, I'll live with the love on you'

1043
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:06,400
'My heart beat is searching for you'

1044
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:12,040
'How can I express my feelings on you'

1045
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:17,260
'I am not with me till now,
ask my shadow which is after you'

1046
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:22,700
'My heart started running for you'

1047
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:28,020
'Listen to me my dear, I love you heartfully'

1048
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:33,480
'Whatever may happen, I'll live with the love on you'

1049
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:39,000
'Listen to me my dear, I love you heartfully'

1050
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:44,660
'Whatever may happen, I'll live with the love on you'

1051
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,340
'Even though this journey started with you'

1052
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:16,620
'How will I reach reach my destination with you'

1053
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:22,160
'Ask every part of me which is getting together with you'

1054
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:27,380
'My crazy jumping heart has started looking for you'

1055
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:32,800
'Listen to me my dear, I love you heartfully'

1056
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:38,260
'Whatever may happen, I'll live with the love on you'

1057
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:43,680
'Listen to me my dear, I love you heartfully'

1058
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:49,380
'Whatever may happen, I'll live with the love on you'

1059
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:59,860
Hey! How are the Sangeeth arrangements going?

1060
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,520
Ammu has got a nice event manager brother.

1061
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,880
Their pre-arrangements are really good.

1062
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:07,820
Especially, the dance choreography is really good.

1063
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:09,280
Oh! Is it?

1064
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:12,720
There you are. He is the choreographer.

1065
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:13,960
You did a really good job.

1066
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:16,120
Its all Ammu mam's guidance.

1067
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:18,420
I just followed it.

1068
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:23,300
He became a headache to me.

1069
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,840
Isn't he cured yet brother?

1070
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:27,800
Why don 't you take him to a nice doctor?

1071
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:30,960
What do I do? He'll not come to the doctor I take him.

1072
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,160
He only let his friends treat him.

1073
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:37,480
His friends are very intelligent doctors.

1074
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,800
I know some good doctors here.

1075
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,720
You don't worry. I'll take him to them.

1076
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,560
They'll cure him very quickly.

1077
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,300
Oh god! Looks like my acting will be revealed.

1078
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:57,600
I need to divert them now.

1079
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:02,340
Daddy!
-What?

1080
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:03,720
I want a helicopter.

1081
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:05,820
Helicopter?

1082
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:09,020
If you get cured, I thought
of starting an airlines with you.

1083
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,500
Hey why don't you compose a nice song for my son?

1084
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:17,400
Sir actually I have an important call.

1085
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:19,060
Mandakini will handle him sir.

1086
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,220
He is better than me.

1087
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:24,620
If you show your talent to people
like him you'll get better opportunities.

1088
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:28,780
Mandakini if you want to become like your master,
start experimenting on my son.

1089
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:29,980
Go and teach!

1090
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,500
Comes lets dance.

1091
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:35,400
I don't know when will he get normal.

1092
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,200
I'll dance to NTR song.

1093
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,040
We'll go to that later, first learn this.

1094
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,800
I think he is convinced that I'm mentally ill.

1095
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,020
Why are you looking like that.

1096
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:53,120
In the condition you are now,
you want to dance to NTR songs?

1097
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:59,800
God is really bad. He gave this much wealth to you.

1098
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,140
If I were this rich...

1099
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:08,140
Its okay leave all that and do what I say.

1100
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:23,280
Why did you call me?

1101
01:33:24,860 --> 01:33:25,540
What if someone see us?

1102
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:29,560
Let them see. We can't hide anything for long, right?

1103
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:30,760
I'll tell them.

1104
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:32,440
What will you say?

1105
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,220
I'll tell that...

1106
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:36,900
Nothing!

1107
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:44,560
Evening everyone is going out to
distribute wedding cards.

1108
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:46,140
No one will be home.

1109
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,840
Should I go with them or stay?

1110
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:50,400
Don't go.

1111
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:51,760
Why?

1112
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:57,540
Nothing!

1113
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:27,180
I think no one is home?

1114
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,300
Why are you looking at the moon like that?

1115
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:35,080
I never felt that moon is beautiful before.

1116
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:38,920
First time its looking really beautiful.

1117
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:42,540
When in love, everything looks beautiful.

1118
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:43,380
What?

1119
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:45,200
Nothing!

1120
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:53,260
I need to tell you something.

1121
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:56,400
Don't tell me anything that disturbs my mood.

1122
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:58,000
Tell them later.

1123
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:01,380
I'm really very happy now.

1124
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,540
Okay then, tell about youself.

1125
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,440
Nothing much to tell.

1126
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:07,580
Nothing!

1127
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:10,180
I'm just living a normal life, working hard.

1128
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,900
Tell me about your parents.

1129
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:13,840
My parents?

1130
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:15,540
There's nothing to say about my dad.

1131
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,340
I love my mother very much.

1132
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:20,740
Mom left me in my childhood by committing suicide.

1133
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:24,600
I'm just living with her memories.

1134
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,680
Did you ever love someone?

1135
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,560
Love? No way!

1136
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,740
I spent my whole life running after responsibilities.

1137
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:35,940
I didn't have the luxury to love someone.

1138
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:38,980
What would happen even if I love?

1139
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:42,680
It will be just some messages and calls.

1140
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,420
What sort of girl do you want?

1141
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,520
The girl should replace my mother with her love.

1142
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:54,500
What should be done to make you feel like that?

1143
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:58,240
It will be only my expectation.

1144
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:00,040
Not possible.

1145
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,340
But first time...

1146
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:03,540
I felt like that after seeing a girl.

1147
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:06,020
I never felt like that before.

1148
01:36:08,660 --> 01:36:10,160
After getting close to you, I felt that.

1149
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:19,340
I thought of telling it to you first.

1150
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:20,820
But you did it first.

1151
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:39,480
No don't!

1152
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:41,960
Don't spoil your good impression.

1153
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:53,020
Lets sleep today by watching the moon.

1154
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,340
Stay where you are.

1155
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:02,660
Be calm.

1156
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,880
You didn't complete my song yet.

1157
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:13,540
Will you teach me a new song?

1158
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,000
Why should I teach you?

1159
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:19,760
You don't understand anything and
your father won't listen to me.

1160
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,020
I'm dying in middle.

1161
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,900
Why are you looking like that?

1162
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,600
You hit me? You look normal too.

1163
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:33,300
Normal? Of course I'm normal.

1164
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:40,780
I'm acting like this as I don't want to
get into my father's business.

1165
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:42,960
You try to command me?

1166
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:47,780
My range is like Pawan Kalyan
in "Attarintiki Dharedhi" movie.

1167
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:52,180
But you try to boss me by
teaching some dance moves?

1168
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:53,800
You try to boss me?

1169
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:58,860
I'm cheating my dad by bringing
some fake certificates from doctors.

1170
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:01,400
And passing my time by having few pegs.

1171
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:04,760
Now you come and command me?

1172
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:09,300
Its not fair to cheat a wonderful father like him.

1173
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:12,100
Why are you worried so much as if he is your father?

1174
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:15,780
Fathers are there to earn.

1175
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,180
And sons are there to enjoy that.

1176
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:21,000
You don't tell me any new rules, got it?

1177
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:22,680
Be careful.

1178
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,240
We are just playing.

1179
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:58,560
The first mistake I did is to raise you
by giving what ever you want.

1180
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:03,380
If I knew that you'll be like this,
I would have earned only for myself.

1181
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:07,860
Unnecessarily I've worked hard
to earn all these to give you.

1182
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:11,460
If you didn't come to office
from tomorrow, I'll see your end.

1183
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:16,900
I'll see why won't you take up the business.

1184
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:26,640
Great timing bro!

1185
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:30,460
Looks like I was here to get you smashed.

1186
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:33,460
We are sad that we don't have a dad that earns like this.

1187
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:36,080
You have a dad that earns well and you are like this.

1188
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:39,600
What sort of life is this?

1189
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:48,000
Shiva get ready in five minutes, we'll go out.

1190
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:49,280
Why?

1191
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:50,940
I want to talk to you.

1192
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:54,320
Why do we need to go out for that, lets talk here.

1193
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:55,700
Its personal Shiva.

1194
01:39:57,340 --> 01:39:58,020
What's personal?

1195
01:39:58,420 --> 01:40:00,420
Personal means personal, go get ready.

1196
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,680
I won't come.
-You won't come?

1197
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:05,020
No!

1198
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:06,340
But why?

1199
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,720
There are some rules for me to come.

1200
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:10,520
What are the rules?

1201
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:12,740
You should understand when I say rules.

1202
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:15,240
Got it.

1203
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:26,540
Not that.
-Then what?

1204
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:29,960
I want the one we missed last night.

1205
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:33,740
You have a lot of movie influence on you, get ready.

1206
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:38,660
All the Telugu movies are like this now-a-days.

1207
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:43,180
Huh! I need to get ready!

1208
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:13,420
Hey Shiva! How's the choreography going?

1209
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,840
Choreography is done sir.
-Then when are you leaving?

1210
01:41:16,700 --> 01:41:20,260
I have a small work here,
so I might go tomorrow or the day after.

1211
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:22,600
One minute sir I have to make a call.

1212
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:35,640
Thank god you got dressed, lets go to shopping.

1213
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:40,240
My friend is admitted in hospital,
so I'm going to meet her.

1214
01:41:40,540 --> 01:41:42,860
What friend you have in Vizag that I don't know about?

1215
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:45,060
She's my cousin's friend.

1216
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:48,660
She helped me a lot once,
so I should go and see her atleast once.

1217
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:50,340
Okay come, I'll drop you.

1218
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:53,080
I've already booked a cab.

1219
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:56,760
It will come to the Banquet at the end of this street.

1220
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:00,120
I'll go then.
-Okay, go!

1221
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:15,040
Hello Mister!

1222
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:19,920
We came here to have a happy time together,
but why are you so serious?

1223
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:24,180
If we get married everyone will say
that I married you only for your money

1224
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:27,360
I thinking of the ways to handle that.

1225
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:33,320
Shiva! Why do we have to care what others think?

1226
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:35,940
I'll tell my dad about us, as soon as I reach home.

1227
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,520
But before that I need to tell you something.

1228
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:43,280
Not now, we'll talk later.

1229
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:46,900
Please listen to me once Shiva.

1230
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:31,020
What happened? Did she say anything?

1231
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:33,220
Nothing!

1232
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:41,400
Did you kill him or what?

1233
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:42,460
No brother!

1234
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:45,600
Wake him up.

1235
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,140
Where is Ammu?

1236
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:49,800
I've killed her. What will you do about it?

1237
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:55,320
Don't lie. She is my sweet heart.

1238
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:58,020
I'll break all your bones and take her from here.

1239
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:00,240
He's out of control.

1240
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,100
Hey hit him with rods.

1241
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:04,180
Come, come rascals!

1242
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:17,100
Looks like he'll kill us.

1243
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:19,060
I should get the girl.

1244
01:46:22,540 --> 01:46:24,680
Sir, please stop. I'm sending her.

1245
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,420
You are asking about him and he is asking about you.

1246
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:30,800
Mam, go.

1247
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:32,260
Or else sir will kill us.

1248
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:13,620
Its okay, don't cry!

1249
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:16,600
What happened? Why are you crying?

1250
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:19,860
He threatened me a lot.

1251
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:20,820
Who?

1252
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:24,580
This guy.

1253
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:26,960
How can you be so harsh on her?

1254
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:28,420
What?

1255
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:30,520
I didn't do or say anything to her.

1256
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:31,880
I swear,.

1257
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:36,420
You are complaining about me unnecessarily.

1258
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:43,720
My boss is calling.

1259
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:46,560
I don't know what to tell him.

1260
01:47:47,140 --> 01:47:47,860
Give it to me.

1261
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:54,800
I saved her even though she is
not an important person in my life.

1262
01:47:55,780 --> 01:47:57,340
Now she is very important part of my life.

1263
01:47:58,520 --> 01:47:59,740
If you again come after her...

1264
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:01,540
I'll not leave you

1265
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:04,520
We've come here on an important work.

1266
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:06,900
After its finished, I'll come and give you the card.

1267
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,800
If you still disturb us...

1268
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:12,460
You can't imagine what my next move will be.

1269
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:25,160
Oh god!

1270
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:29,280
Did it hurt bad?

1271
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:34,320
Its all for you, so I don't have any pain.

1272
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:41,860
Its yours.

1273
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:43,480
One minute, its bluetooth.

1274
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:50,300
Hi dear! How are you?

1275
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:53,460
Hi dad! I'm fine, how are you?

1276
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:54,320
I'm fine dear.

1277
01:48:54,700 --> 01:48:57,000
Why didn't you call me since a week, Are you busy?

1278
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:58,620
Yes dad!

1279
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:02,480
Okay! The matter is
you said okay to a marriage proposal, right?

1280
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,320
They keep on pushing me about it.

1281
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:08,480
If you come early, we'll do the remaining arrangements.

1282
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:09,880
When are you coming back?

1283
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:12,500
I've already asked Megha's dad to inform you about this.

1284
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,100
Did he inform you?

1285
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:19,440
Dad I'll call you back.

1286
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:33,220
Why didn't you tell me that your marriage got fixed?

1287
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:37,220
I didn't accept the marriage out of interest in it.

1288
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:39,040
After you came into my life...

1289
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:39,540
Don't tell me.

1290
01:49:40,660 --> 01:49:41,320
I understood.

1291
01:49:42,580 --> 01:49:45,660
You said okay to it and here you are
having me as a temporary boy friend.

1292
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:47,280
Don't talk like that Shiva.

1293
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:47,780
Then what should I speak?

1294
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,260
You asked me a question,do you remember?

1295
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:57,000
If I was in love ever.

1296
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:58,260
Never!

1297
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:00,860
You know why?

1298
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:03,500
I don't have the guts to take this pain.

1299
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:06,500
But you gave me more than the pain I've imagined.

1300
01:50:07,580 --> 01:50:08,720
Listen to me Shiva!

1301
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:10,320
Don't talk.

1302
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:12,580
From now, we will not be together.

1303
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:02,120
You go first.

1304
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:03,820
They'll suspect.

1305
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:05,360
Shiva please.

1306
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:07,720
Listen to me once.
-No I won't.

1307
01:51:09,340 --> 01:51:10,480
Please Shiva.
-I won't listen.

1308
01:51:27,540 --> 01:51:29,080
Wait I need to talk to you.

1309
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:34,720
How Megha and you are best friends...

1310
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:36,760
Me and your dad are also same.

1311
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:41,940
The matter is that you are not at all
showing interest in the proposal you've agreed.

1312
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:44,100
When we do an event...

1313
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:47,340
Photographer, Choreographer, DJ are all options.

1314
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:48,900
We can change them whenever we want.

1315
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:52,340
But the proposal father got you is not an option dear.

1316
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,820
So you should agree with your parents.

1317
01:51:57,300 --> 01:51:58,940
It will be good for everyone.

1318
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,760
We should always try to multiply our respect and wealth.

1319
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:05,660
Not to diminish them.

1320
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,300
I hope you understand why I'm saying all this.

1321
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,660
Shiva wait. I need to talk to you.

1322
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:21,660
Here is your payment of one Lakh.

1323
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,820
I'm giving you extra fifty thousand.

1324
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:24,880
Do you know why?

1325
01:52:25,220 --> 01:52:26,980
For you to not come back.

1326
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,220
You grow by working hard.

1327
01:52:30,740 --> 01:52:36,440
But its not correct to trap a
rich girl and become rich over night.

1328
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:39,920
Is she you daughter?

1329
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,600
She is like my daughter. So what?

1330
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:46,880
If I worked only as a choreographer...

1331
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:48,520
She'll won't be with you now.

1332
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:49,980
Ask her the reason for that.

1333
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:53,580
I'll never have the thought of
getting rich the way you said.

1334
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:55,760
Take back your cheque.

1335
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:59,200
I never thought that I'll be an option in someone's life.

1336
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:29,860
Every youngster will fall in love at come point in life.

1337
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:34,160
But whomever they love,
they'll be left with tragedy at the end.

1338
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:36,500
This is my story till now.

1339
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:40,500
Let's see how it will be in future.

1340
01:54:49,020 --> 01:54:49,900
Tell me sir, you asked me to come.

1341
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:53,740
All the Telugu associates in
Singapore are planning some events.

1342
01:54:53,940 --> 01:54:55,660
There is a need for a choreographer in that.

1343
01:54:57,020 --> 01:54:59,220
If you are okay with that, I'll talk to them.

1344
01:55:00,780 --> 01:55:05,080
You should bare all the expenses including tickets.

1345
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:08,520
If its okay for you...

1346
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:10,240
I'll talk to them.

1347
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:11,260
Sure sir!

1348
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:13,280
Thank you so much for giving me this offer.

1349
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:16,160
I'll arrange the money soon and contact you.

1350
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,040
What happened there Shiva?

1351
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:19,840
Nothing sir, a small accident.

1352
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,940
Okay Shiva all the best. See you soon.

1353
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:03,540
Why are you looking at me like that my son?

1354
01:56:03,940 --> 01:56:05,380
Is it because I was drunk?

1355
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:11,480
Every house should have a hard working son like you.

1356
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:17,180
Then only father can happily relax like me.

1357
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:22,380
One should have luck for all that dad.

1358
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:25,320
You are very lucky.

1359
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:29,900
I have a doubt dad.

1360
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:33,080
Do you have any shame in you?

1361
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:36,940
When your son is working hard,
you are passing the time by getting drunk daily.

1362
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:40,980
Did you ever ask yourself about how hard I'm working?

1363
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:46,080
Why should I? As a son, its your responsibility.

1364
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,860
I'm correcting all the mistakes you've done.

1365
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:50,960
Do you know how hard and painful it is?

1366
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:54,040
No son whose has some goals, have a father like you.

1367
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:58,840
If the government gets a rule
to kill all the father's like you...

1368
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:00,260
I'll be the first person to be happy.

1369
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:04,640
Don't you know the rule to respect your parents?

1370
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:07,700
Even animals have children.
But it doesn't make them parents.

1371
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:11,620
Parents are those who are responsible.

1372
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:16,020
In every house, father's are the strength.

1373
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:18,140
But you are a big minus for me.

1374
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:23,740
My mom, who left me with her
memories by committing suicide and you...

1375
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:25,660
Will never mean anything to me.

1376
01:57:39,900 --> 01:57:41,760
How can you leave me and go dear?

1377
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:45,440
I came all the way there only for you.

1378
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:49,060
I'll leave if you don't like me.

1379
01:57:49,580 --> 01:57:51,700
How many times did I tell you that I don't like you?

1380
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:54,420
But you still don't get it.

1381
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:56,880
You want marriage, right?

1382
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:58,280
You said it many times.

1383
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:00,160
I'll also become a financier like you for living.

1384
01:58:01,340 --> 01:58:03,740
Because people like me shouldn't have goals.

1385
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:07,860
Tell after you've finished all the arrangements.

1386
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:09,900
I'll compromise and live with you.

1387
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:25,800
This site is the only memory of your mother left.
You want to sell it?

1388
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:27,440
Think about it once.

1389
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:28,420
No other option.

1390
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:31,060
Sometimes to grow in life...

1391
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:33,420
We have to do something like this.

1392
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:37,140
After going there I'll send you money every month.

1393
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:39,340
Take care of my father.

1394
01:58:40,420 --> 01:58:41,600
Then what about me?

1395
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:46,440
How did she come here?

1396
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:55,840
Where is you sir? He's not answering my calls.

1397
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:57,040
You want to talk to him, right?

1398
01:58:57,800 --> 01:58:59,860
I'll take care don't worry.

1399
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:03,920
I've sent the location to her sir.

1400
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:06,920
You always do useless things well, Mandakini.

1401
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:08,780
Then what should I do sir?

1402
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:10,080
Why always everyone should listen to you?

1403
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:11,180
Why don't you listen to them?

1404
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:12,760
You should give a chance to others too.

1405
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:14,720
She is trying to call you many times.

1406
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:16,320
You won't listen to her.

1407
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:17,560
Why are you rising your voice?

1408
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:19,320
You both talk, I'll leave.

1409
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:21,680
I'll deal with you later Mandakini.

1410
01:59:21,680 --> 01:59:23,540
I've heard a lot like this.

1411
01:59:24,060 --> 01:59:25,280
Even he is harsh with me.

1412
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:27,480
Please listen to me once Shiva.

1413
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:28,560
I won't!

1414
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:30,780
Will you listen or not?
-No I won't.

1415
01:59:31,740 --> 01:59:32,240
You won't listen?

1416
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:37,340
What are you doing?

1417
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:40,700
What's this assault?

1418
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:41,960
What, assault?

1419
01:59:42,540 --> 01:59:44,460
You broke up with me and went away
without even listening to me.

1420
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:45,920
What do you call that then?

1421
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:53,000
You told me to look with my eyes down and
the world looks very beautiful.

1422
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:56,960
From that day, you became my world unnoticeably.

1423
01:59:57,180 --> 02:00:00,760
I tried many times to tell you this, but you never let me.

1424
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:05,040
You went away from me but I'm having the punishment.

1425
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:06,620
She's right.

1426
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:26,560
I should hit you hard.

1427
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:28,500
Okay!

1428
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:40,380
Who is it at this time?

1429
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:44,340
Hey where is the card?

1430
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:45,980
Card? What card?

1431
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:47,500
Wedding card?

1432
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:49,420
We patched up just now.

1433
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:52,100
After the marriage got fixed, I'll send you the first card.

1434
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:54,260
I'm asking about the memory card.

1435
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:56,240
Memory card? I already gave it.

1436
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:57,260
To whom?

1437
02:00:57,260 --> 02:00:58,480
Of course to the police.

1438
02:00:58,980 --> 02:01:00,460
They must be on the way to your house.

1439
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:03,860
After all these fights and chases
why would I give it to you ?

1440
02:01:04,700 --> 02:01:06,540
They might me on the way, don't worry.

1441
02:01:08,780 --> 02:01:09,280
Who is that?

1442
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:10,360
Who else.

1443
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:12,660
Your fans. Sorry, our fans.

1444
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:19,140
He gave the card to the Police?

1445
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:24,760
I expected it.

1446
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:28,340
Okay! Lets have lunch.

1447
02:01:29,700 --> 02:01:30,300
Why are looking like that?

1448
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:32,520
Prison food will not be good.

1449
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:35,480
So lets have lunch and go.

1450
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:44,180
Stay here Shiva.

1451
02:01:44,180 --> 02:01:46,200
I'll come in five minutes after that we'll go out.

1452
02:01:49,300 --> 02:01:51,800
After marriage every word seems very sweet.

1453
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:54,520
I'm feeling shy!

1454
02:01:59,220 --> 02:02:00,360
Why these idiots are coming?

1455
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:03,280
Why you guys are here?

1456
02:02:03,820 --> 02:02:05,240
I think you are missing me a lot.

1457
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:06,680
Its nothing like that.

1458
02:02:07,060 --> 02:02:08,840
Looks like you've settled well after marriage.

1459
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:10,880
Of course I did.

1460
02:02:11,160 --> 02:02:14,940
As if I was working in a sports academy
you always keep on chasing me.

1461
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:16,000
Half of my life is wasted with that.

1462
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:17,300
Its all gone now.

1463
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:18,680
I gave all the money back.

1464
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:21,120
With interest in a single payment.

1465
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:23,720
All the Villas from here to there are mine.

1466
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:24,900
I can live with their rents.

1467
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:27,240
This seems good.

1468
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:29,300
As you came here anyway, lets have lunch.

1469
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:30,720
We didn't come here for lunch.

1470
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:32,480
We are here to take you.

1471
02:02:33,580 --> 02:02:34,440
They started it again.

1472
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:36,300
You are not getting it.

1473
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:38,140
That episode is done, okay?

1474
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:40,140
So please go away from here.

1475
02:02:40,380 --> 02:02:41,540
Listen to me first.

1476
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:45,060
You said some sentimental dialogues to our sister.

1477
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:47,680
She became mad and got admitted in the hospital.

1478
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:49,820
She is always mad and you joined her.

1479
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,200
You kept on doing whatever she says.

1480
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:52,840
This property belongs to my wife now.

1481
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:54,960
I'm married now.

1482
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:57,280
I'm officially husband to my wife.

1483
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,740
So you need my wife's permission for anything.

1484
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:04,280
Tell me.

1485
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:06,360
Meet my wife Ammu.

1486
02:03:06,660 --> 02:03:08,080
She is very good, not like your sister.

1487
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:10,360
See Ammu, they are trying to take me.

1488
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:13,000
Tell them that this husband belongs to you.

1489
02:03:14,740 --> 02:03:15,380
Take him.

1490
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:23,080
What's wrong? Why did you tell them to take me?

1491
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:25,880
What should I do?

1492
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:29,360
You tortured me a lot without answering my calls.

1493
02:03:30,100 --> 02:03:32,300
I had to solve all my problems.

1494
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:35,480
In the same way, you solve your problems now.

1495
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:37,880
Don't bring your problems to me please.

1496
02:03:38,260 --> 02:03:40,940
This is wrong Ammu.

1497
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:43,860
They already came to me and took permission.

1498
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:45,820
You take him guys.
-Thank you sister.

1499
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:48,760
This is not fair Ammu.

1500
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:49,920
I'm your husband Ammu.

1501
02:03:50,980 --> 02:03:52,900
This is very injustice Ammu.
